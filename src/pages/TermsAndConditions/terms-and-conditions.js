            Before starting any order, please read and understand the following
            terms and conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To be able to commit an order one needs to create an account.
              Creating an account only takes a few moments where you can save
              your details for future orders. We do not accept orders made by
              any other means.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you place your order it is an offer by you to enter into a
              legal contract with us.
            </li>
            <li>
              We and you will only enter into a binding contract when you
              receive notification from us that we have accepted your order and
              that a binding contract exists from the date and time specified in
              the notification.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every care is taken to ensure that prices and availability are
              correct and up to date. In case that current stock quantity of a
              selected product is depleted, we only charge for the delivered
              products.
            </li>
            <li>
              The price you will pay will be that stated at the time you place
              your order.
            </li>
            <li>Items are dispatched within two working days.</li>

              Payment will be effected in cash or by cheque upon delivery.
              Deliveries are made at the ground floor level. No deliveries are
              made on Sundays, public and national holidays. Our normal delivery
              times are:
              <br />
              From 9:00am &#8211; 4:00pm Monday – Friday
            </li>
            <li>
              The person receiving the delivery will be asked to sign in order
              to signify receipt of the goods. Kindly make sure that if you are
              paying by cash, you have the correct amount available. No change
              is possible.

            <li>
              You may benefit from a 10% discount on the full amount purchased
              if you choose the option to pick it up from our new premises in
              Msida Valley Road, B’Kara. This option can be chosen before you
              click on checkout. After checkout the system will send you an
              e-mail providing you with an order number. This number must be
              quoted to collect your items.
            </li>

              Where we have accepted an order from you and have received
              payment, if the payment is subsequently refused or rejected then
              we reserve the right to refuse to provide any further items you
              have ordered.

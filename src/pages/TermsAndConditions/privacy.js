                PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE FOR THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The personal data you have provided (“Data”) will be processed for
              the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Providing the requested service (&#8220;Service”) according to
                the agreement between you and Motors Inc. Limited;
              </li>
              <li>
                Allowing the Company to perform surveys on customers
                satisfaction (“Customer Satisfaction”) related to the quality of
                Company goods and services according to the Company legitimate
                interest;
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The Data may be processed in hardcopy, by automated or electronic

            <p>
              <strong>CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE DATA</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Submitting the Data is never mandatory. However, not providing the
              Data marked as mandatory will prevent the Company from providing
              the Service. On the other hand, not providing the optional Data
              will allow you to access the Service anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RECIPIENTS OF THE DATA</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Data may be processed by natural persons and/or legal
              entities, acting on behalf of the Company and under specific
              contractual obligations, based in EU Member States or in countries
              outside the EU.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Data may be communicated to third parties to comply with legal
              obligations, to execute Public Authorities orders or to exercise a
              Company right before judicial authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>DATA TRANSFER OUTSIDE OF THE EEA</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Within its contractual relations the Company may transfer the Data
              in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA),
              including store them in databases managed by entities acting on
              behalf of the Company. Databases management and Data processing
              are bound to the purposes of the processing and are carried out
              according to applicable data protection law.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case the Data are transferred outside of the EEA the Company
              will use any appropriate contractual measures to guarantee an
              adequate protection of the Data including – among the others –
              agreements based on the standard contractual clauses adopted by
              the EU Commission to rule the transfer of personal data outside of
              the EEA.
